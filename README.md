Mini projects done for fun

Hoping to pick up healthy coding practices, one meme at a time.

Update: For meme.py, realised that the `global` declarations were terrible. Senseless use of it on my first attempt at solving the challenge. I now realise that it could be solved more efficiently using arrays to store the directions and performing modulo operations. Will re-attempt this when I have the time!
